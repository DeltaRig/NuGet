# Create an OOP based System for Storing School Data and Deploy it as a NuGet Package 
NuGet is a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy for developers to create, share, and consume useful code.

## Environment:

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/ 

> Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json -Version 13.0.1 

## My NuGet

https://www.nuget.org/packages/ClassLibraryDPRigoli/

## Challenge description
Write a program that will allow storing data about students, teachers, and subjects using structs. The application will allow the addition of data and then returning all the data as string output. The main application will be a Windows Class Project, which can be converted into a NuGet package. 

#### Background of the problem statement: 

Rainbow School is developing a simple OOP based system for storing information about teachers, students, and subjects. This system is based on C#. The school wants to distribute this system for free via the NuGet package system.
